# HTML Assesment
This project imitates a basic web page using HTML and HTML functions. Some of the HTML technology used were text blocks, a table, a list, and a form. It also includes working links to the team's respective homepages as well as images of their team logos. This was an introduction to HTML for me and a chance to practice what I've learned.
